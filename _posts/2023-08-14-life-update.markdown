I remember a time when life was fairly simple, even if it didn't feel like it. This was in the mid-80s, then the late 90s before I was forcibly made single by a finally-disinterested girlfriend, and in the early 2000s after moving to London, having a job, and enjoying being married.

Now I still have a job (although one many-times removed from that one I scored in my early London period), still married. But shit's complicated.

I'm constantly tired. I have a persistently-sore shoulder from some sort of rotator cuff injury; I've been given exercises for it, but my shoulder is too sore to do them. So it never becomes not sore.

I have a new job, which thanks for a grotesque notice period I'm still 7 weeks away from starting. But by all accounts it'll be my dream job, and I honestly can't wait. But before then I need to sort out my sleep. And, preferably, my shoulder.

And I have a desire to write a blog but keep forgetting I have *this* one.

Life come at you fast.
